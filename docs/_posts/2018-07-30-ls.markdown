<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
At one point in my career I was interviewing for a company whos name I'm not going to mention.  The entire interview
revolved around on tiny string of text:
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
ls > txt
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
That's it, that's the command.  The majority of the 1-hour interview was spent on talking about ever single thing
that happens with this command.  This was probably one of my top 5 interviews because of how simple the command was
but how difficult the answers ended up being.  And I do mean answers, like there are many questions that spring
up from this command.  This post is my attempt at recreating every detail of this path as my way of practice.
</p>

<p>
Before we begin, I want to say that this is probably the absolute worst way to determine long-term success at a company.
Mainly because this is something that we don't use during our day-to-day operations.  Most of what we actually need
at the job is a positive attitude and a sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
With that said, this is meant to be fun and maybe a little entertaining.  It's possible that I'm missing out on some
details, if you catch something, let me know so I can make the document as complete as possible.  I'll make sure I 
put your name in the credits of any edits.
