<p>
I'm a cloud hacker type.  My focus is around AWS orchestration and automation.  However, I've also worked with GCP and GKE as well as kube on its own.

<p>
My passion is for working with smaller companies or large startups.  Early in my career I ventured into the world of enterprises and learned that I am not a good
fit for those types of environments.  I find that fast, nimble environments are my favorite.  Good engineering is a combination of quality technical excellence
and knowing how to convince people not to blow their face off.

<p>
I treat my career like a startup; like the startup of me.  Failures and pivots are always part of the process.
