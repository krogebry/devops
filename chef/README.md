# Why

It's good to know how all of the configuration management system work at a high level.
It's also good to know the specific details, patterns and implimentations of at least one
of these systems.

Chef is an amazing tool for the devops space because it's the only tool in the space
that truely embraces the "Infrastructure as Code" mindset.  Other systems are mostly
declarative, in nature, but only Chef allows for the integration and "mingling" of
declarative stanzas and code.

The flexiblity of Chef is what helps it stand out from other systems.

There are many ways of approaching any of the below topics, but for the puprose of this
project we're going to stick with a few very narrow-focused excersizes to show off very
specific patterns.  The goal here is to show why knowing these patterns are important
in the devops space.

( It all boils down to knowing how to move fast and build things )
