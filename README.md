# The DevOps project

A project to teach some of the tatics and strategies in the devops world.

# Background

My background and skill sets.

# Why?

Let's start with asking the question of "why."  Why do this, why bother?

In 2016 I attended the infamous Burning Man event.  My gift to the people of the Playa was
a black velcro patch with the words "A World That Burns For Everyone."  The message is one
that embraces one of the tenants of "the burn": radical inclusion.

I want a world where everyone is able to make the pilgrimage to Black Rock City and have
their own kind of experience that is whatever it needs to be for them.  

I carry this sentiment into this project: I want everyone to be able to participate
in the world of devops.  The goal being to create ways for everyone to participate
in the world of devops in whatever form that means.

The way in which we go about reaching this goal is to explain some of the tactics
used in many devops practices.  For example, that might mean describing how a configuration
management workflow might look.  Or how we view compute resources as trashable things
that we can throw away at any point.

There are many small things that we devops engineers do on a daily basis that might
seem like dark magic to developers, or even some of the older generation operational
engineers.

This project is broken down in a serious of articles and sample code describing a particular topic.
