# Nomad

Introduction into what this is and why.

# Clothes

For the most part I have managed to standardize my clothing.  Standardizing my clothing has helped me in managing my inventory of available items.  For example, I know I carry exactly 4 pairs of tactical pants and 1 pair of regular jeans.  This helps me when it comes to planning trips and knowing what I can pack and what I need to leave behind.

All of the 5.11 things have attributes that make these items particularly attractive:

* Almost everything is double stitched, so things are extra tough and last longer.

## Tactical pants

[![5.11 pants][511_pants]](https://www.amazon.com/5-11-74273-Mens-TacLite-38W-36L/dp/B001V2Z9F2/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_img_12?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=4Z2QXCKRS617V3NMBHJK)

* The pants have extra padding around the knees which doesn't really do me any good in the day-to-day actives, but does keep things from wearing down in that area.
* They also have a knife pocket on the left hip, and a smaller, less obvious pocket on the right hip.  Some of the designs vary on this, but the idea is that there are extra front pockets for knifes or other gear.  I use the left pocket for my hotel key most of the time as it's a perfect fit.

## Tactical shirt

[![511_tactical_shirt][511_tactical_shirt]](https://www.amazon.com/5-11-50159-CAMS-Rolling-Duffle/dp/B01G2E6E3Y/ref=pd_sim_200_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=N40D30W311PD2T4EA7KX)

This is the 5.11 brand tactical shirt.  These are heavy shirts for sure, and will get you boiling fast.  However, they are also tough as nails, comfortable and very handy.  These shirts are good for me because keeping my gear ( kindle, battery, phone ) on my chest is easier than in my pockets because the seats on the airplanes make getting things out of lower pockets more difficult.

* The shirts have large breast pockets which can hold something as large as a kindle tablet, or as heavy as an Anker battery.  This is very handy for traveling.
* There is a short sleeve and long sleeve variation on these shirts.  I generally use the short sleeve shirt for travel days, and the long sleeve shirts for more heavy duty work, or if I'm going to be out in the sun.  

# Hotel living

## Laundry basket

This can fold up into a very small space and makes for a handy laundry basket.

## Toiletries bag

This holds all of my grooming gear.

# Gear

## Laptop bag

[![goruck_bag]]()

Tough, rugged and functional bag for my every day carry.

## MOLLE pouch

[![drop_bag]](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I81KSBY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

This bag is one of two bags that I use for my electronics load out.  It's big enough to hold my bigger, odder shaped gear:

* Moto 360 charger
* Macbook charger cable
* Beats pill
* Outlet extender

## T&T Pouch

[![ebag]](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0046O0PEC/ref=twister_B0175GAGLE?th=1)

This is the bag that I use for my smaller connector things and usb cables.

# Travel

## Carry-on luggage

[![Hazard 4 CarryOn][hazard_carryon]](https://www.amazon.com/Hazard-Support-Rugged-Rolling-Carry/dp/B00AJ5F7BS/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_img_11?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=4Z2QXCKRS617V3NMBHJK)

This is my main travel bag for weekend trips.  It has many MOLLE straps along its body, but I so far haven't really used any of them for anything.  My big fear with these is that anything I attach will either be sheared off while checked in, or won't fit in the overhead.  The bag has plenty of room for my standard issue set of weekend gear:

* Workout shoes
* Toiletries bag
* Kilt + Hippie shirt
* Work laptop
* Macbook charger

Everything else like underwear and workout clothes are at home waiting for me.  All I really need to pack in this bag are the things I will need while traveling, or things that I don't (yet) have at home ( like the kilt or toiletries ).

## Long-haul bag

[![soms_bag][soms_bag]](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2YGRTG/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

This is the 5.11 SOMS ( Some Of My Shit/Stuff ) bag.  This is used as my long-haul carry bag.  Due to the size and weight of this guy I need to check it in when flying.  This is why I usually try to fly Southwest when hauling this bag to or from a remote location.  As long as it's under 50lbs, I can check it for free, but if it's over 50lbs, or I'm flying with a different carrier, I'll have to pay more to have it shipped.  Usually it's around $100 if it's over 50lbs, or $50 just to check it on any airline that isn't Southwest.

I can easily fit more than 50lbs of gear.  In fact, there's actually a bigger version of this called the [CAMS](https://www.amazon.com/5-11-50159-CAMS-Rolling-Duffle/dp/B01G2E6E3Y/ref=pd_sim_200_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=N40D30W311PD2T4EA7KX) ( Carry All My Shit ) bag.  The CAMS can easily hold 90lbs of gear, which is actually a big problem.  Most airlines have an absolute hard limit of 75lbs for any bag.  I usually have to plan around the 50lbs limit with the SOMS bag by putting my heaviest gear in my carry on.

When I first started I used the CAMS bag and ended up deciding that it's just too big for what I need.  The temptation to load all kinds of crap into that massive bag was just too great.  During that trip I ended up using two gym bags to carry my gear, which worked fine.  Now I have things like a meditation pillow, which is light, but awkward, so the SOMS bag works very well for helping me get oddly shaped gear into one place.

When I travel back to home I pack the majority of my gear into my SOMS bag, then throw it and some other things into a storage unit that's on the way to the airport.

## AmazonBasics travel cubes

# Logistics

## Storage Unit

I keep a 5x5 storage unit at the local Public Storage unit.  I have the option of storing my gear at the front desk of the hotel, but I started to worry about this a little.  The storage location at the hotel is just an office in the back, so there really is no security at all.  This isn't terribly worrisome as I doubt anyone would actually want any of my clothes and so far I haven't had a need to store anything terribly valuable.

However, there is no security policy or replacement guarantee with the hotel; they are storing my gear as a courtesy to me.  If there's an emergency at home or I decide to work from home for a week I worry that my gear isn't secure.  It really comes down to piece of mind for me on this one.  I want to know that my gear is stored behind a locked door that only I ( or maybe someone from work that I trust ) has access to it.

Having a storage unit also allows me to store anything else that I might want to store, like a bike or compute equipment that I want to keep under my control.  Along with this I can also give access to this unit to other people in the office who might want the same thing as far as security.
