Introduction into what this is and why.

# Clothes

For the most part I have managed to standardize my clothing.  Standardizing my clothing has helped me in managing my inventory of avaliable items.  For example, I know I carry exactly 4 pairs of tactical pants and 1 pair of regular jeans.  This helps me when it comes to planning trips and knowing what I can pack and what I need to leave behind.

All of the 5.11 things have attributes that make these items particularly attractive:

* Almost everything is double stitched, so things are extra tough and last longer.

## Tactical pants

* The pants have extra padding around the knees which doesn't really do me any good in the day-to-day activies, but does keep things from wearing down in that area.
* They also have a knife pocket on the left hip, and a smaller, less obvious pocket on the right hip.  Some of the designs vary on this, but the idea is that there are extra front pockets for knifes or other gear.  I use the left pocket for my hotel key most of the time as it's a perfect fit.

## Tactical shirt

This is the 5.11 brand tactical shirt.  These are heavy shirts for sure, and will get you boiling fast.  However, they are also tough as nails, comfortable and very handy.  These shirts are good for me because keeping my gear ( kindle, battery, phone ) on my chest is easier than in my pockets because the seats on the airplanes make getting things out of lower pockets more difficult.

* The shirts have large breast pockets which can hold soomething as large as a kindle tablet, or as heavy as an Anker battery.  This is very handy for traveling.
* There is a short sleve and long sleve variation on these shirts.  I generally use the short sleve shirt for travel days, and the long sleve shirts for more heavy duty work, or if I'm going to be out in the sun.
