Introduction into what this is and why.

# Clothes

For the most part I have managed to standardize my clothing.  Standardizing my clothing has helped me in managing my inventory of avaliable items.  For example, I know I carry exactly 4 pairs of tactical pants and 1 pair of regular jeans.  This helps me when it comes to planning trips and knowing what I can pack and what I need to leave behind.

All of the 5.11 things have attributes that make these items particularly attractive:

* Almost everything is double stitched, so things are extra tough and last longer.

## Tactical pants

* The pants have extra padding around the knees which doesn't really do me any good in the day-to-day activies, but does keep things from wearing down in that area.
* They also have a knife pocket on the left hip, and a smaller, less obvious pocket on the right hip.  Some of the designs vary on this, but the idea is that there are extra front pockets for knifes or other gear.  I use the left pocket for my hotel key most of the time as it's a perfect fit.

## Tactical shirt

This is the 5.11 brand tactical shirt.  These are heavy shirts for sure, and will get you boiling fast.  However, they are also tough as nails, comfortable and very handy.  These shirts are good for me because keeping my gear ( kindle, battery, phone ) on my chest is easier than in my pockets because the seats on the airplanes make getting things out of lower pockets more difficult.

* The shirts have large breast pockets which can hold soomething as large as a kindle tablet, or as heavy as an Anker battery.  This is very handy for traveling.
* There is a short sleve and long sleve variation on these shirts.  I generally use the short sleve shirt for travel days, and the long sleve shirts for more heavy duty work, or if I'm going to be out in the sun.  


# Gear

## Carry-on luggage

This is my main travel bag for weekend trips.  It has many MOLLE straps along its body, but I so far haven't really used any of them for anything.  My big fear with these is that anything I attach will either be sheared off while checked in, or won't fit in the overhead.  The bag has plenty of room for my standard issue set of weekend gear:

* Workout shoes
* Toiletries bag
* Kilt + Hippie shirt
* Work laptop
* Macbook charger

Everything else like underware and workout clothes are at home waiting for me.  All I really need to pack in this bag are the things I will need while traveling, or things that I don't (yet) have at home ( like the kilt or tolietries ).

## Long-haul bag

[![soms_bag][soms_bag]](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2YGRTG/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

This is the 5.11 SOMS ( Some Of My Shit/Stuff ) bag.  This is used as my long-haul carry bag.  Due to the size and weight of this guy I need to check it in when flying.  This is why I usually try to fly Southwest when hauling this bag to or from a remote location.  As long as it's under 50lbs, I can check it for free, but if it's over 50lbs, or I'm flying with a different carrier, I'll have to pay more to have it shipped.  Usually it's around $100 if it's over 50lbs, or $50 just to check it on any airline that isn't Southwest.

I can easially fit more than 50lbs of gear.  In fact, there's actually a bigger version of this called the [CAMS](https://www.amazon.com/5-11-50159-CAMS-Rolling-Duffle/dp/B01G2E6E3Y/ref=pd_sim_200_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=N40D30W311PD2T4EA7KX) ( Carry All My Shit ) bag.  The CAMS can easilly hold 90lbs of gear, which is actually a big problem.  Most airlines have an absolute hard limit of 75lbs for any bag.  I usually have to plan around the 50lbs limit with the SOMS bag by putting my heaviest gear in my carry on.

When I first started I used the CAMS bag and ended up deciding that it's just too big for what I need.  The temptation to load all kinds of crap into that massive bag was just too great.  During that trip I ended up using two gym bags to carry my gear, which worked fine.  Now I have things like a meditation pillow, which is light, but akward, so the SOMS bag works very well for helping me get oddly shapped gear into one place.

When I travel back to home I pack the majority of my gear into my SOMS bag, then throw it and some other things into a storage unit that's on the way to the airport.

## Storage Unit

I keep a 5x5 storage unit at the local Public Storage unit.
