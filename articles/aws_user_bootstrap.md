# Why?

I want to teach you how to use AWS.

* So that you understand how things work, at least at a basic level.
* Because I want you to participate in projects with me.
* Because collaboration is fun.
* You'll need these tools and things in place as your baseline knowledge so that you can collaborate and participate.
* Learning the cloud can be fun, and maybe even useful.

# How?

We'll start with the basics:

* Logging into AWS with a user account.
* Learning a little about IAM.
* Creating your first user keys.
* Running your first AWS CLI commands.
* Creating, running, and logging into your first ec2 instance.
